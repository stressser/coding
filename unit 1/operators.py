# Operators
# Operators are a construct (built in system) that
# data types more actions and power.

# Arithmetic family of operators (math)
# Arithmetic operators are just math operations
# The OR operator checks if ONE of the conditions is TRUE.
# So long as ONE of the conditions is TRUE, it will be TRUE.
print (2 == 1 or 3 > 2)
# If BOTH are TRUE the answer is TRUE.

print (not(3 > 1 and "Beau == Beau"))
# The NOT operator will give the opposite result.
# The NOT operator flips the result.

alegebraPassed = True
historyPassed = True

# does this person need credit recovery
# true means they passed
print (not(alegebraPassed== TRUE and historyPassed =TRUE))
