# Problem 1 
# Name = input("What is your name:")
# Age = input("What is your age:")

# Problem 2
Bonus = '200'
# print(300 + int(Bonus)) # result should be 500


# Problem 3
# HINT: use w3schools to find a data casting function that will change
# a data type into a boolean

vaule = 'True'

print(True == Vaule) # result should be true
